{- Project Euler
Problem 21
==========


   Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than
   n which divide evenly into n).
   If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair
   and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

   For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22,
   44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1,
   2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

   Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
